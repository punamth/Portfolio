1. Extract the ZIP Folder
For starting the project , simply download the zip file and extract to the destined folder.

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed (use version 16 or above for best compatibility).
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the following command to install dependencies (this reads the package.json):
>>> npm install

3. Run the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed, start the Vite development server
>>> npm run dev

4. Open the App in Your Browser
After running the dev command, Vite will show a local server address (typically http://localhost:5173).
Open this address in your browser to view your React app.
